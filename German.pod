=head1 NAME

Text::German - German grundform reduction

=head1 SYNOPSYS

C<use Text::German;>

C<$stem = Text::German::reduce($word)>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a rather incomplete implementaion of work done by Gudrun
Putze-Meier F<E<lt>gudrun.pm@t-online.deE<gt>>. I have to confess that
I never read her original paper. So all credit belongs to her, all
bugs are mine. I tried to get some insight from an implementation of
two students of mine. They remain anonymous because their work was the
wost piece of code I ever saw. My code behaves mostly as their
implementation did except it is about 75 times faster.
