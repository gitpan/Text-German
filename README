NAME
       Text::German - German grundform reduction

SYNOPSYS
       use Text::German

       $stem = Text::German::reduce($word)

DESCRIPTION
       This is a rather incomplete implementaion of work done by
       Gudrun Putze-Meier <gudrun.pm@t-online.de>. I have to
       confess that I never read her original paper. So all
       credit belongs to her, all bugs are mine. I tried to get
       some insight from an implementation of two students of
       mine. They remain anonymous because their work was the
       wost piece of code I ever saw. My code behaves mostly as
       their implementation did except it is about 75 times
       faster.
