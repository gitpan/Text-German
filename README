NAME
    Text::German - German grundform reduction

SYNOPSYS
    "use Text::German;"

    "$stem = Text::German::reduce($word)"

DESCRIPTION
    This is a rather incomplete implementaion of work done by Gudrun
    Putze-Meier. I have to confess that I never read her original paper. So
    all credit belongs to her, all bugs are mine. I tried to get some
    insight from an implementation of two students of mine. They remain
    anonymous because their work was the wost piece of code I ever saw. My
    code behaves mostly as their implementation did except it is about 75
    times faster.
